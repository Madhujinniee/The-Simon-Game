# 🎮✨ The Simon Game – *Memory Challenge Reloaded!*

🔹 This is my **first interactive project using jQuery** – and it’s a classic! 🥳

## 🧠 About the Game:
The Simon Game is a fun and challenging memory game where you have to follow a growing pattern of colors and sounds.

🔴🟢🔵🟡 Four colorful buttons light up in a random sequence...  
Your task? 👉 **Repeat the pattern exactly!** 🎵  
Miss a step, and it’s game over! 😅

## 🚀 Technologies Used:
- 💻 **HTML** – for structuring the game layout  
- 🎨 **CSS** – to style and animate the buttons  
- ⚙️ **JavaScript** – for game logic and interactivity  
- 💡 **jQuery** – my first hands-on experience with it, used for event handling, animations, and game logic! 🙌
